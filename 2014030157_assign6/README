#README for assignment 6 course HPY414


Code in C programming language that utilizes a low level Packet Capture tool.

Folder contains:

	-assign_6.c
	"Contains the C code used for utilizing the Tool (aka, my 1st time meeting: pcap and netinet ).
  The Tool provides online and offline capture mode use <<$ ./assign -h>> to prompt a help message for Tool usage."

	-Makefile
  "$ make run <--Compile assign_6.c file."

  -test_pcap_5mins.pcap
  "used as example for the offline capture mode."
    as such: $ ./assign -r test_pcap_5mins.pcap

Answer to question possed in assigment: It's possible to tell if an incoming TCP packet is a retransmission
	because TCP protocol uses ACK to tell the transmitter if a retransmission is needed, but with UDP protocol
	retransimissions do not occur.

There are comments on the code for further code explanation where needed.
